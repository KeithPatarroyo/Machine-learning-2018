    "Let $D = \\{d_1,... , d_n\\}$ be a set of documents and $T = \\{t_1, . . . , t_m\\}$ a set of terms (words). Let $T D = (T D_{i,j} )_{i=1...m,j=1...n}$ be a matrix such that $T D_{i,j}$ corresponds to the number of times the term $t_i$ appears in the document $d_j$ . Also, let $l_i$ be the length, number of characters, of term $t_i$ , and let $L = (l_1, . . . , l_m)$ be a column vector. Finally, assume a process where a document $d_j$ is randomly chosen with uniform probability and then a term $t_i$, present in $d_j$ ,is randomly chosen with a probability proportional to the frequency of $t_i$ in $d_j$.\n",
